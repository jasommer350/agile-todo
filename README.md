agile-todo
==========

A simple manager for dealing with Agile Scrum development projects and a todo manager with task timer for keeping track of how long you work on tasks during the day.

It runs locally on your computer using IndexedDB, I found best results when running it with the latest Chrome browser, I did not try and build in a lot of backward compatibility.  This keep the project simple.
